## **Introduction**

The Carbon Credit Management System leverages blockchain technology to provide a transparent, decentralized, and efficient solution for carbon credit management. The platform ensures traceability, prevents fraud, and simplifies the process for all stakeholders in the carbon market, from issuers to traders and end-users.

### **Why This Project Matters**

- Traditional carbon credit systems are prone to inefficiencies, lack transparency, and can lead to fraud or double counting.
- This blockchain-based platform eliminates these issues by leveraging smart contracts for secure and transparent transactions.

---

## **Features**

### **Core Functionalities**
1. **Issuance**:
   - Only accredited issuers (e.g., governments, NGOs) can issue new carbon credits.
   - Each issued credit is immutably recorded on the blockchain.

2. **Trading**:
   - Peer-to-peer trading with real-time settlement and transparent pricing.
   - Secure smart contracts to prevent market manipulation.

3. **Retirement**:
   - Carbon credits can be permanently retired to offset carbon emissions.
   - Retired credits are recorded to ensure they cannot be reused.

### **Additional Features**
- **Dashboard**: View issued and retired credits in real time.
- **Marketplace**: Trade credits securely and transparently.
- **Data Transparency**: An immutable ledger ensures traceability and public verification.
